This repo is a copy of the project that I worked on while interning at Software Freedom School.
I have taken out sensitive information, and the way we set up deployment. The purpose of this repo
is to showcase my abilities to create a website with both a frontend and a backend. I am continuing
to work on this project on my own, and make it better.
